## Usage
A fun way to study coding.

## Credits
The question bank came from many questions from BootCampSpot's Interview Prep with the Technical Assessments. 

### Useful Links
[Sorting Function](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp) - The table sorting function is based off of this.

## Challenges To Work On / Future Updates to this Page
- Make the designer easier for mobile devices - some questions/answers that have very long strings of words fall off the page. Maybe make it so that when one answer is selected, the rest disappear so it's easier to see whether it was incorrect or correct. 
- When there is an incorrect button selected, make the color different
- Randomize the order of the all the questions in the questions bank, not just the choices
- Add sound effects or little animations to signify getting a question right/wrong
